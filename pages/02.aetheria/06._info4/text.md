# **Ship-shape and Up to Specs**

You don't have to be an engineer to design a spaceship, but it sure helps with the wrongful death suits! Engage with our deep ship customization mechanics, where every component has its own personality and every Mega has their own catalogue of parts for sale (and not for sale?). Upgrade your ship, arrange your armaments and accoutrements for maximum efficacy, and fancy up the exterior to suit your tastes. We promise not to judge.
