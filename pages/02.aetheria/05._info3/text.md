# **Real Stakes**

Ever play an MMO where you (and every other player) were given a quest to save the world and kill the Big Bad Evil Guy, but the game is happy to wait while you go off slaying rabbits or delivering letters?

In Aetheria your actions have consequences. If you fail to save the world, it may well be destroyed, forcing players to adapt or perish. If you, personally, slay the BBEG, his influence will stop. The world and even gameplay can look very different depending on the actions of players.
