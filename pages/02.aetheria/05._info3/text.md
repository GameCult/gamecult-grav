# **Real Stakes**

Ever play an MMO where you were just given a quest to save the world, but the game is happy to wait while you go off slaying rabbits or delivering letters?

In Aetheria your actions have consequences. If you fail to save the world, it may well be destroyed, forcing players to adapt or perish.
