# Total Catastrophe

Investigate strange affairs and divest yourself of stranger fares. In Aetheria: L’appel du Vide you play as Catastrophe “Cat” Marrigan, an out of work private investigator, driving a particularly failure-prone space taxi to make ends meet. Named by prescient parents, it is your fate to trip, trick, sneak, and stumble into the secrets of a displaced people, uncovering the truth of a fantastic journey, the shape of things to come, and exactly what happened to your favourite hat.
