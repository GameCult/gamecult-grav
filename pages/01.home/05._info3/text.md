# **Games as a Service**

Give away the razor, sell the blades. Games as a Service is big business, and despite many Software as a Service companies committing to Open Source, conventional game studios seem reluctant to follow. GameCult is taking that leap, with flagship multiplayer experiences that are hard to duplicate (due to server infrastructure and network effects) and easy to monetize. Revenue from these sources can fund our single player passion projects which we only charge a nominal fee to install via digital distribution. Our games are for everyone, and you'll never need to pay just to experience them.
