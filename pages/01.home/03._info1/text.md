## **Democratizing Gamedev**

Getting paid to work with us? You better believe it! With bounty-driven development, itâ€™s easy for passionate members of the community to get involved with our projects and even get paid for their work. When something needs to get done, we create an issue and assign a bounty. Even our core team gets paid this way rather than collecting a salary. Earn contribution points to level up and gain perks like management votes and all-expense-paid vacations (which may include team building activities).
