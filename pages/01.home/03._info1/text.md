# **Democratizing Gamedev**

Getting paid to work on Open Source games? You better believe it! With bounty-driven development, itâ€™s easy for passionate members of the community to get involved with our projects and even get paid for their work. When something needs to get done, we create an issue and assign a bounty. Earn contribution points to level up and gain perks like management votes and all-expense-paid vacations (which may include team building activities).
