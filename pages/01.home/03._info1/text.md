# **Democratizing Gamedev**

Getting paid to work on Open Source games? You better believe it! With bounty-driven development, itâ€™s easy for passionate members of the community to get involved with our projects and even get paid for their work. When something needs to get done, we create an issue and assign a bounty, which will be allocated to the contributor's internal capital account when the work is complete. Contributors can cash out whenever they want, and once they have reached a certain historical patronage threshold they are eligible to become voting members of the organization's worker class.

As a multi-stakeholder cooperative, dedicated members of the community can also become consumer-class stakeholders for an affordable recurring membership fee. This gives them the power to vote on matters of business, game design, development and work prioritization. Got a bug that's bothering you or a feature you really want to see? Vote for it! This model allows us to build a more equitable and sustainable relationship with our community and guarantees that our games exist to serve the needs of gamers.
